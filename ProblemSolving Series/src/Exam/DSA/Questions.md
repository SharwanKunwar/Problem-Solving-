# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Common Theory Questions

This document contains **important and frequently asked DSA theory questions** for **BCA / 3rd Semester exams**.  
Use this for **quick revision before exams**.

---

## 1️⃣ What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of **organizing and storing data** in memory so that it can be **accessed and modified efficiently**.

---

## 2️⃣ What is DSA?
DSA stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
It focuses on **storing data efficiently** and **solving problems using step-by-step algorithms**.

---

## 3️⃣ What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a **finite sequence of steps** used to solve a specific problem.

---

## 4️⃣ Types of Data Structures
### 🔹 Primitive
- int
- char
- float
- double

### 🔹 Non-Primitive
- **Linear:** Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List
- **Non-Linear:** Tree, Graph

---

## 5️⃣ What is Stack?
A stack is a **linear data structure** that follows the **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle.

### Operations:
- push
- pop
- peek

---

## 6️⃣ What is Queue?
A queue is a **linear data structure** that follows the **FIFO (First In First Out)** principle.

### Operations:
- enqueue
- dequeue

---

## 7️⃣ Difference Between Stack and Queue

| Stack | Queue |
|------|------|
| LIFO | FIFO |
| Insert & delete from same end | Insert at rear, delete from front |
| push(), pop() | enqueue(), dequeue() |

---

## 8️⃣ What is Linked List?
A linked list is a collection of **nodes**, where each node contains:
- data
- address of next node

---

## 9️⃣ Types of Linked List
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

---

## 🔟 What is Linear Queue and Circular Queue?
- **Linear Queue:** Wasted space after deletion
- **Circular Queue:** Reuses space using modulo operation

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ What is Infix, Prefix, and Postfix?
- **Infix:** A + B
- **Prefix:** + A B
- **Postfix:** A B +

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Why Stack is Used in Expression Evaluation?
Stack is used to:
- Handle operator precedence
- Convert expressions
- Evaluate postfix and prefix expressions

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What is Overflow and Underflow?
- **Overflow:** Inserting into a full data structure
- **Underflow:** Deleting from an empty data structure

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity represents **how execution time grows with input size**.

### Common Time Complexities:
- O(1) – Constant
- O(n) – Linear
- O(n²) – Quadratic

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Array vs Linked List

| Array | Linked List |
|------|------------|
| Fixed size | Dynamic size |
| Fast access | Slow access |
| Memory wastage | Efficient memory |

---

## ⭐ Most Important Topics for Exams
✔ Stack  
✔ Queue (Linear & Circular)  
✔ Stack using Linked List  
✔ Queue using Linked List  
✔ Infix → Postfix / Prefix  
✔ Overflow & Underflow
